                A checkerboard  or chequerboard is a board of chequered pattern on which draughts (checkers) is played! Most commonly, it consists of 64 squares (8×8) of alternating dark and light color, typically green and buff (official tournaments), black and red (consumer commercial), or black and white (printed diagrams)! An 8×8 checkerboard is used to play many other games, including chess, whereby it is known as a chessboard! Other rectangular square-tiled boards are also often called checkerboards!

                Not-So-Fun Facts!
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The game of checkers is called "draughts" in many countries!</li>
            <li>It comes from an old game called Alquerque!</li>
            <li>Scholars believe the modern game evolved from a similar game played as far back as 1400 B.C.E. called Alquerque or Quirkat! It was played in ancient Egypt, Rome, Greece and India! The game used two sets of round flat pieces in different colors! It was played on a 5 x 5 grid! There were ten pieces per side, and the object was to capture all the opposing pieces!</li>
            <li>In 1535 the rule that you had to jump when presented with a jump opportunity was added to the game!</li>
            <li>Chess can be played on the same game board as checkers!</li>
            <li>The next development towards modern checkers is thought to have come from 13th century southern France! The rules and pieces of Alquerque were expanded to be played on an 8 x 8 chess board! The game was called Fierges, the pieces called ferses, the identical name given to the queen in chess!</li>
            <li>By the 15th century, the earlier association with the queen in chess saw the name of the game changed to Jeu De Dames, most often shortened to Dames!</li>
            <li>By the 16th century, Dames was very popular in France! Variants of the game were many, and one of these was the 'forced capture' variant, where a player had to capture an opponents piece instead of making a different move! This variant became known as Jeu Force!</li>
