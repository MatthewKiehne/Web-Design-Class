        <h4>My Favorite Things</h4>
        <p>One of my favorite things to do in my spare time is to go biking. It helps me relax and I get my exercise in for the day. Another one of my favorite things to do is playing board games with fiends. Getting together with friends after a long day also helps me relax and catch up with my friends. Both of these things help me relax after a long day and that is why they are my favorite. </p>
